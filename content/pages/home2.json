  "body": "We are a non-profit membership society which encourages the introduction and culture of gesneriads. We hold meetings ten months out of the year where we meet to exchange plants and information, enjoy a program to better understand our plants, hold a raffle and a business meeting. **New members are welcome.**\n\nWe have access to rare and unusual gesneriads through our international society and from other members. We maintain a library of gesneriad reference materials which members may borrow. We offer hard-to-obtain supplies to our members at cost.\n\nWe educate the public about gesneriads and their culture by holding an **Annual Show and Sale** as well as providing speakers to other groups as requested. We enjoy the \"_Gesneriads_\" magazine which is published four times a year by the Gesneriad Society. The magazine contains valuable written information and photographs. Members may borrow back issues from our library, and are encouraged to join the parent society to receive their own issues either as a \"green\" on-line publication or as handsome print copies. Information on membership is available at [www.gesneriadsociety.com](https://www.gesneriadsociety.com).\n\nHello, this is a first edit."
